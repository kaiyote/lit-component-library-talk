            <p>
              In the distant past, the original dev team made the, I'll call it questionable, decision to
              write the entire application as a monolithic ColdFusion application, complete with 90% of the
              business logic embedded into the database.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the less distant past, a new dev team was brought in, and started using the new-and-shiny-at-the-time
              front-end framework of Ember 3.0 to rebuild the user experience. They also built their own microservices
              to talk to, but that is unimportant to this talk.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, corporate bought another product, that dev team likes React, so they start building their chunk of
              the app in React. It doesn't interact with the ember portion, so its "fine".
            </p>
            <p>
              History repeats itself, and new teams are acquired, each with their own existing front-end preferences,
              and so everything just gets stitched together from various single-page applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can get all of the pages to mostly look the same with some global CSS and some gentle guidance, but when
              it comes to user interactions with more complex controls, it starts to break down. I can tell you from experience
              that even things as simple as the speed of the ripple in a material button differs across the various implementations.

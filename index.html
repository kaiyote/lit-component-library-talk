            So, if any of you went to the Web Components pre compiler on Teusday morning, you might get the slightest
            hint of deja-vu from this talk. In the wildest stroke of unintentional luck, it turns out Burton stole my
            entire talk and padded it out to 4 hours (and expertly done at that).

            Jokes aside, I'm not kidding that this talk is basically a highly compressed version of that pre-compiler.
            There are a couple differences/new things here, but if you want to leave now, you'll only hurt my feelings
            a little bit.

          <h1>The Why</h1>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              So, the product I work on at Fuse was originally written in ColdFusion. Just one big monolith, 90% of the
              business logic in the database, the whole 9 yards. The people who built it were solid developers, but they
              were decidedly not front end devs, and so the css in particular suffered for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, still before my time, new devs joined, old devs left, it was decided they should start modernizing
              the front end, they chose Ember for the task, and they got to it. Replaced most of the external facing pages
              wrote their own shiny new CSS, and everything was great.
            </p>
            <p>
              But same old same old, teams shifted, etc, etc, the new devs decided that React was the new hotness. They
              modernized a few of the remaining external pages that'd been left in CF, and even started in on the older
              ember pages. Complete with their own, even shinier and newer CSS, and everything was awesome.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, another team in a more sectioned off part of the app decided they wanted to use Angular
              to start modernizing their peice. And so they did. With their own shiny new CSS. All built in the aim of
              adhering to the style guide granted to us from on high.
            </p>
            <p>
              New teams, new devs, etc, etc, now Vue is the new hotness. Complete with those devs opinions on how best to
              implement the style guide, complete with the newest and shiniest CSS. You can see where this is going.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, the real fun part is that our styleguide is Material-ish. Its close enough that you can almost get away
              with using whatever material library for your framework, but you will inevitably have to tweak something. This
              leads to multiple teams using multiple material libraries, each having to tweak them in unique ways, and not
              tweaking them consistently with each other, such that you'd end up in an uncanny valley situation as you went
              between pages that used different frameworks, where certain things would like *almost* the same, and function
              *almost* the same, but they'd be off in vague and unsettling ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, there was a component library developed by an in house team, and written in Angular. Obviously, that
              doesn't help the non-Angular product teams, so they also compiled those components using Angular Elements.
              Works great, except. Now you're shipping Angular + that pages main framework. And there's angular-isms in
              Angular that don't actually translate well, or at all, in to Angular Elements. There were actually 3
              of the original Angular components that just never made the jump to Angular Elements, and there were a handful
              more that worked, but only in the most simple cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, that component library fell to me to maintain, and I eventually just got tired of dealing w/ Angular
              and went hunting for something else that would consistently work across all of our frameworks, and I landed on
              web components.

          <h1>So why Web Components?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Web Standard since HTML5</li>
            <li class="fragment">Use them in any framework</li>
            <li class="fragment">Shadow DOM</li>
            <li class="fragment">Progressive Enhancement</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Web components have been a thing for almost a decade now. All current browsers support them.
              You could even run them in IE11 thanks to polyfills, but now that Microsoft is ended
              support for IE11 we don't even have to worry about that.
            </p>
            <p>
              They work in any framework. Merely load the JS and use the tags and you're good to go.
              Now.. there are some caveats to the actual useability in certain frameworks. In Vue, you
              need to tell the compiler that any tag matching a pattern is a web-component and it should
              treat them as such. It'll still do it, but it'll warn you in dev mode that its assuming this
              is what you meant. Angular needs you to setup the custom elements schema in the module where
              you're rendering them. React is another story. Basic attributes work, but event binding is a mess,
              and so are any complex attributes/properties. There are wrappers around to wrap any web component
              in a way that React can use them "like native", tho, and support for just being able to use them
              *should* be landing in React 19, so things are looking up there.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shadow DOM makes it so that your styles and html are encapsulated from the host document.
              No more fighting styles (mostly), no more important wars. Your component will look exactly as
              you intended on every page, no matter what css the host has loaded. There are of course ways to
              enable styling of internals of your web components, but those methods now become part of the API
              of your component, and must be fairly explicitly coded to in order to affect the styling.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can just rewrite a single control into a web-component, load its javascript on the page,
              and replace the existing legacy control. You don't have to whole-sale rip your app apart to be
              able to make use of web components.

          <h1>So why lit?</h1>

            <li>The replacement for Polymer</li>
            <li class="fragment">Builds standards complaint web-components</li>
            <li class="fragment">Tiny Bundle</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              At Google I/O 2018, Google announced that LitElement would be the replacement for the
              PolymerElement base class from polymer.
            </p>
            <p>
              LitElement extends from HtmlElement and just adds a few niceties. This means you are just writing
              straight web-components, with a few extra features thrown in to handle reactive state and
              declarative rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entirety of Lit is only 5kb minified and gzipped, so it adds basically nothing to your bundle. Lit components in
              general are already pretty small already, so you end up with impressively small bundles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The shared library I'm building at Fuse has somewhere around 15 different components, and the entire bundle is only
              50kb minified and gzipped, and the majority of that is styles.

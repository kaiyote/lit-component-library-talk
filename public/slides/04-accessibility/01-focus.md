## Keyboard focus

Just works.

Anything that is normally keyboard focusable outside of a web-component will still be focusable inside it.

This includes but is not limited to: <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- inputs <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- things with an explicit tab-order <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- everything you'd expect to be tabable <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

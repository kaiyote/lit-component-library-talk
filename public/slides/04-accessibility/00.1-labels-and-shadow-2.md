## Labels And The Shadow DOM

So there are two ways to do this:
- Require label and the element its for to be passed in as slotted elements. This way they both come from the application and are at the same level. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

  <span class="fragment">

  ```html
  <shadow-tag>
    <label for="my-input">label text</label>
    <input id="my-input" />
  </shadow-tag>
  ```

  </span>

- Take the label text in as a prop (or slot it if you feel like it) and render both controls internally <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

  <span class="fragment">

  ```html
  <shadow-tag label-text="whatever">
    <!-- shadow dom -->
      <label for="my-internal-input">${this.label-text}</label>
      <input id="my-internal-input" />
    <!-- end shadow -->
  </shadow-tag>
  ```

  </span>

Notes:
- Because of this, there are 2 ways to go about handling this.
- Option 1: make the application using your component pass in both the label and the input.
  - This gives the application the most control over its inputs and such, and makes the lit component be responsible mostly for rendering/styles.
  - You can still get ahold of the input in lit if you need to attach events / otherwise control it.
- Option 2: you render the label and the input internally.
  - You can always take in the label text as a prop or a slot if necessary to allow that level of customization.
  - Change & Input events are composed, so the application can still listen for those events on the root lit tag and they'll come through from the internal input just fine.
- The option is up to you (and I've used both styles of implementation, it really depends on what the purpose/complexity of your component is)

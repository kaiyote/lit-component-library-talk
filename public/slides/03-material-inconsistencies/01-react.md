## MUI (react):

Probably the closest in terminology of the three packages being compared

- Button
  - covers text, outlined, and contained via the `variant` prop
  - also allows for a "flat" contained button
- ButtonGroup (this is the toggle button)
  - this is a wrapper for MUI Button's that causes them to behave like a toggle button
- Fab
  - its the Floating Action Button, as its own component
  - what it says on the tin
